# 💣 Payload Analysis & Bypass Guide

A complete guide for bug bounty hunters and penetration testers to analyze how their payloads are executed or blocked on target applications. Learn how to detect reflection, identify payload context, and bypass WAF, IPS, IDS, and Cloudflare protections across common web vulnerabilities.



## 📌 What's Inside?

- 🔍 How to analyze payload reflection in source/DOM
- 🧠 Context-based payload crafting (HTML, JS, Attributes)
- 🛡️ WAF/IPS/Cloudflare bypass techniques
- ✅ Execution detection signs for each vulnerability
- 🔧 Real-world examples for:
  - XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
  - SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)
  - Path Traversal
  - SQL Injection
  - IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)
  - LFI/RFI (File Inclusion)
  - RCE (Remote Code Execution)
  - Open Redirect
  - Host Header Injection

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Inject a test payload (e.g. `vgodXSS123`)
2. Open page source or DevTools → Inspect how it's rendered
3. Match context using the guide
4. Select the correct bypass payload
5. Use Collaborator/interact.sh for blind vectors
6. Confirm execution via behavior, delay, or output

## 📘 Perfect For

- Bug bounty hunters
- Pentesters
- Red teamers
- Web security learners
- Anyone serious about exploiting & understanding WAF-protected web apps
